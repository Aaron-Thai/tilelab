# Geog 458 Lab 4: Making tiles and Mapbox

### Introduction
We have displayed four different tilesets on a webmap 
using Mapbox Studio, Mapbox GL JS, QGIS, and QMetaTiles.

The examined geographic area is Washington State,
and our thematic layer is nursing home locations in the state.

The available zoom levels of each tileset are set from 1-8 in QGIS and QMetaTiles.

This section will have screenshots of the four layers and brief descriptions of each tileset.
